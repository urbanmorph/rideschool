        <ul>
          <li>Low or no traffic area/low traffic road. Example: playground, parking lot, driveway of an institution etc. However, it should not be an isolated location which participants may find unsafe to come and get trained. </li>
          <li>Even surface such as paved, tarred, stoneless ground etc. The slope should be gentle (1-3 degrees). </li>
          <li>Road width - Enough space should be available for the cycle learner to drift sideways without hitting any obstacle.</li>
          <li>Adequate lighting has to be ensured if the trainings are planned early morning or evenings.</li>
        </ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: kannada">Once all approvals are in place, the organization can publicise about the training programs through different platforms to ensure that potential candidates are well informed about the program. During the outreach programs, the organizations are expected to follow the prescribed terms and conditions relating to branding etc.</li>
